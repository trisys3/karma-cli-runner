Better CLI for karma

Quite simply, `karma`, the "Spectacular Test Runner" from the folks behind Angular, doesn't have a good CLI, and this project is an attempt to rectify that. The API mirrors `karma`'s as much as possible, while smoothing out the rough edges of its CLI.

## Differences From Vanilla Karma:
* Better support for merging your options with `karma`'s.
* Support for options meant to be lists, including `--files`.

This repository is still a work in progress, and I am eagerly accepting pull requests.
